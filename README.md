## Project Overview

Welcome to the Superhero Squad Showcase, a dynamic web app that introduces you to an amazing squad of superheroes! This project focuses on fetching superhero data from an external JSON file and presenting it in an engaging and user-friendly interface.

## Features and Achievements

### 1. Dynamic Population

The heart of this project lies in its ability to dynamically populate the webpage with superhero information. Leveraging asynchronous JavaScript, the app fetches data usign the FETCH API from a [superheroes.json](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/oojs/json/superheroes.json) file.

### 2. Header Display

The header section beautifully showcases key squad details, including the squad name, hometown, and formation date

### 3. Superhero Cards

Each superhero is featured on a dedicated card, providing an organized layout. The card includes essential details such as the hero's name, secret identity, age, and a list of superpowers retrieved from the JSON data. The use of semantic HTML elements enhances accessibility and search engine optimization.
